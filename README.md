# Option-Pricing-Dashboard
A comprehensive Python-based options pricing and risk analysis tool implementing Black-Scholes model, Monte Carlo simulation, and complete Greeks calculation with interactive visualizations.

### **Overview**
This Python project calculates option prices and risk metrics (Greeks) for European call and put options. It implements:

- Black-Scholes Model for option pricing
- Monte Carlo Simulation for price estimation
- Greeks Calculation: Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta, Rho

The dashboard allows users to input option parameters, calculates prices and Greeks, visualizes payoff diagrams, and interprets results for risk management.

### **Features**

### **User Input & Flexibility**

- Input any option type (call or put)
- Specify spot price, strike price, time to expiry, volatility, and risk-free rate

### **Option Pricing**

- Black-Scholes theoretical price
- Monte Carlo simulation price with 50,000 paths

### **Greeks & Risk Metrics**

- Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta, Rho
- Understand sensitivity to spot price, volatility, time decay, and interest rates

### **Visualizations**

- Payoff diagram vs. intrinsic value
- Greeks bar chart
- Highlights in-the-money, out-of-the-money, or at-the-money options
- Quick insight into option moneyness and potential profit
- Shows how each Greek affects option risk
